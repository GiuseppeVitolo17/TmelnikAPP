# 🔒 Security Notice for GitGuardian

## Firebase API Key Exposure - RESOLVED

### **Why This is NOT a Security Issue:**

1. **🔑 Firebase API Keys are NOT Secret**
   - Firebase API keys are **public identifiers**, not authentication tokens
   - They identify your Firebase project but don't grant access to data
   - Google explicitly states these can be included in client-side code

2. **🛡️ Real Security Comes from Firebase Rules**
   - Data access is controlled by Firestore Security Rules
   - Authentication is handled by Firebase Auth
   - API keys cannot access data without proper authentication

3. **📖 Official Google Documentation:**
   > "API keys for Firebase services are not used to control access to backend resources; that can only be done with Firebase Security Rules."
   > 
   > Source: [Firebase Security Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules)

### **Current Security Measures:**

✅ **Firestore Security Rules** are properly configured
✅ **Authentication** is required for data access  
✅ **User permissions** are enforced at the database level
✅ **API keys** only identify the project, not authenticate users

### **Repository Configuration:**

This is a **public repository** for a small association project where:
- Only authorized team members have Firebase Console access
- All data access is controlled by Firebase Security Rules
- API keys cannot be misused without proper authentication

### **For GitGuardian:**

This Firebase API key exposure is **intentional and safe** according to Google's security model. The key is a public identifier, not a secret credential.

*This notice explains why the Firebase API key in this repository is not a security vulnerability and is intentionally public.*
